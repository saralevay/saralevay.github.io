# Hello

<img src="./media/sl.png" alt="Clusters" align="left" style="width:20%; height:auto; margin-right:50px;">
I am Sara, a physics postdoc, working on active matter and granular matter systems. I obtained my PhD in 2021 at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. I studied different granular systems by DEM simulations. After a postdoc in Hungary and in France, now I work in Spain on my MSCA project called PhotoActive.

I hope you find my projects interesting :)

# News

* **17/02/2025** - We have published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10079" target="_blank">preprint on arXiv</a> about the shear flows of elongated granular particles. We have shown that modulated shear induce transverse vortices.

* **06/02/2025** - I gave a seminar at UNAV about the kinetic model we developed for the cluster dynamics of our photoactive agents.

* **19/12/2024** - Our first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14419" target="_blank">preprint</a> of [project PhotoActive](./photoactive.html) is available on arXiv! It is about the cluster dynamics of macroscopic photoactive particles.
