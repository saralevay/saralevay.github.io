# Hello

<img src="./media/sl.png" alt="Clusters" align="left" style="width:20%; height:auto; margin-right:50px;">
I’m Sara, a physics postdoctoral researcher fascinated by the dynamics of active matter and granular systems. I earned my PhD in 2021 at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, where I explored granular materials through DEM simulations and spent part of my doctoral work in Germany. After postdoctoral work in Hungary and France, I moved to Spain for my MSCA project PhotoActive, spending two years investigating light-responsive active matter. Since completing the project, I’ve continued my research in Spain as a postdoc, now working with a diverse range of active matter systems at the University of Navarra.

I hope you find my projects interesting :)
