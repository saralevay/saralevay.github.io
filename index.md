# Hello

<img src="./media/sl.png" alt="Clusters" align="left" style="width:20%; height:auto; margin-right:50px;">
I’m Sara, a physics postdoctoral researcher fascinated by the dynamics of active matter and granular systems. I earned my PhD in 2021 at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, where I explored granular materials through DEM simulations and spent part of my doctoral work in Germany. After postdoctoral work in Hungary and France, I moved to Spain for my MSCA project PhotoActive, spending two years investigating light-responsive active matter. Since completing the project, I’ve continued my research in Spain as a postdoc, now working with a diverse range of active matter systems at the University of Navarra.

I hope you find my projects interesting :)

* **26/08/2025** - Our paper has been <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/t7st-flj2" target="_blank">published in PRL</a>. It presents our new experimental setup and the study of cluster dynamics of macroscopic photoactive particles.

* **20/06/2025** - I gave a talk at FisEs'25 (XXV Congreso de Física Estadística) en Santiago de Compostela titled "Collective dynamics of macroscopic photoactive particles".

* **09/07/2025** - Our paper about the shear flow of elongated granular particles has been <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/875y-lk88" target="_blank">published in Physical Review E</a>.

* **20/03/2025** - I gave a talk at the APS Global Physics Summit in Anaheim (CA) titled <a href="https://summit.aps.org/smt/2025/events/MAR-S64/5" target="_blank">Collective behavior of photoactive macroscopic particles: an experimental study of cluster dynamics</a>.

* **17/02/2025** - We have published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10079" target="_blank">preprint on arXiv</a> about the shear flows of elongated granular particles. We have shown that modulated shear induces transverse vortices.

* **19/12/2024** - Our first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14419" target="_blank">preprint</a> of [project PhotoActive](./photoactive.html) is available on arXiv! It is about the cluster dynamics of macroscopic photoactive particles.

* **18/12/2024** - I visited my secondary school in my hometown to give a talk about my current projects and share with interested students how I became a physicist.

* **04/12/2024** - I gave a talk at the Traffic and Granular Flow conference in Lyon, presenting the results of PhotoActive.

* **04/11/2024** - With my colleagues, we participated in the 2nd Spanish Soft Matter 1 1/2 Day in Benasque. I gave a talk about PhotoActive.
