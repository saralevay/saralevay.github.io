# Hello

<img src="./media/sl.png" alt="Clusters" align="left" style="width:20%; height:auto; margin-right:50px;">
I am Sara, a physics postdoc, working on active matter and granular matter systems. I obtained my PhD in 2021 at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. I studied different granular systems through DEM simulations. After a postdoc in Hungary and France, I now work in Spain on my MSCA project called PhotoActive.

I hope you find my projects interesting :)

# News

* **17/02/2025** - We have published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10079" target="_blank">preprint on arXiv</a> about the shear flows of elongated granular particles. We have shown that modulated shear induces transverse vortices.

* **06/02/2025** - I gave a seminar at UNAV about the kinetic model we developed for the cluster dynamics of our photoactive agents.

* **19/12/2024** - Our first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14419" target="_blank">preprint</a> of [project PhotoActive](./photoactive.html) is available on arXiv! It is about the cluster dynamics of macroscopic photoactive particles.


* **18/12/2024** - I visited to my secondary school in my hometown to give a talk about my current projects and share with interested students how I became a physicist.

* **04/12/2024** - I gave a talk at the Traffic and Granular Flow conference in Lyon, presenting the results of PhotoActive.

* **04/11/2024** - With my colleagues, we participated in the 2nd Spanish Soft Matter 1 1/2 Day in Benasque. I gave a talk about PhotoActive.
