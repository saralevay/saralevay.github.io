# What are we doing?

We are working with small bugs that move when they are illuminated. When we illuminate them more, they move faster, when the illumination intensity is lower, they move slower. We created an arena with a huge LED panel, where we can control the illumination in space and time. We place lots of bugs in the arena, apply different illumination patterns and intensities, and we study how the bugs behave. As they move, they collide with each other, and with the surrounding walls. They form groups, that can move or stay stable. These groups can split, merge and show really interesting behavior. Sounds fun?

### This is the experimental setup

The particles are made of <a href="https://hexbug.com/" target="_blank">Hexbug nano-s</a>. Hexbugs are small "robots" with a small battery, a rotating motor, and flexible tilted rubber legs. When you turn them on, they start to vibrate and move. We made a small modification on the Hexbugs, as you can see above. We removed the battery, and added the red plastic cap that holds a photovoltaic cell. In this way the bugs can move only when they are illuminated. When we illuminate them more, they vibrate stronger and thus propel faster. On the other hand, when the illumination is lower, the vibration is weaker, and their velocity is smaller. This means, that we can tune the activity of the particles by changing the illumination.


### This is how the particles move with different illumination...

In order to change the illumination, we have created a huge (80 cm x 80 cm) illumination panel from LED lines, that we can control completely. We can program the light intensity line-by-line, meaning that the illumination protocol can be changed in space and time. With this we have an external control on the activity of the bugs. We place the bugs beneath the illumination panel. They are running in an arena with a size of 80 cm x 80 cm, surrounded by walls. The walls a 3D-printed, so we can change their shape and size easily.

When we place lots of bugs into the arena and turn on the light, they start to move, collide with each other and the walls, and show a really interesting collective behavior. We record videos with a camera placed beneath the arena, and by analyzing the videos, we can track and follow the movement of the particles. From this we calculate many interesting things.

### ... and this is how a collision looks like

# What we have studied so far?

First of all, we focused on homogeneous illumination in the arena. We have studied how groups of particles, clusters, are being created and destroyed. We used different particle polulations and different illumination intensities and made lots of experiments.

### This is an image from the experiments

As particles collide, they form groups, called clusters. Sometimes these clusters are smaller, sometimes larger. They can move or stay at the walls. When new particles are colliding with the cluster they can attach to it. Also, particles can leave the cluster.

We have seen that small clusters tend to disassociate relatively quickly, while large clusters usually have a longer duration. This depends a lot on the activity of the bugs. If they are more active, they move a lot and have lots of collisions inside the clusters as well, which facilitates the dissolution the the group.

### In this video you can check how the clusters behave

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wMwmL4mDQV-yT5vslmJWSbXSGugTfVp6/preview" width="450" height="450" allow="autoplay" align="right" style="margin-left:50px;"></iframe>
This wideo shows an experiment with 120 particles at a low homogeneous illumination intensity.

You can see that lots of clusters are being formed. Some of them are relatively large, and stay for a long time. Most of them dissolves after a while, but there is one (the yellow one) that grows constantly, stays stable, and by the end of the experiment, incorporates around 75% of the bugs.

By conducting many experiments, we have seen, that low illumination and high population promotes the stabilization of the clusters.

For low particle populations and high particle activities clusters form and disassociate quickly. These clusters are unstable. But as we increase the particle population and decrease the activity we see a transition from unstable to stable clusters. Stable clusters grow, incorporate the majority of the bugs, and stay stable during the whole experiment.

If you would like to know more about this transition, check our [preprint on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14419){:target="_blank"}. We have also developed a kinetic model to describe the time evolution of clusters, which shows a nice agreement with the experiments.

# What are we working on right now?

We turned from homogeneous illuminations to inhomogeneous ones, to use the versatility of our experiment. We study how bugs are accumulating at less-illuminated regions, how this is related to the formation of clusters, and what happens if we suddenly increase the illumination in these regions. We are also doing simulations, to gain a deeper understanding of the particle motion.

Stay tuned, as new results are coming soon!
